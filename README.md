## 🎉 About

LuaEncode is a simple library for serialization of Lua tables and basic data types, along with support for all of Roblox's engine data types. LuaEncode supports both Luau and Lua 5.1+

### 🌟 Features

* Serialization and output of basic types `number`, `string`, `table`, `boolean`, and `nil` for key/values
* Pretty-printing and custom indentation configuration
* Compatible with Roblox's engine data types (`Instance`, `UDim2`, `Vector3`, `DateTime`, etc..) - See **[Roblox Engine Data Type Coverage](#roblox-engine-data-type-coverage)** for more info
* Secure table iteration and value reading, with potentially untrusted inputs in-mind
* Manual cycle inserts in serialized codegen with [`InsertCycles`](#api)
* Extended raw key/value inserts with [`FunctionsReturnRaw`](#api)

___

## ⚙️ Installation

* ### Rojo/Wally

    If you're using [Rojo](https://rojo.space) and [Wally](https://wally.run/), you can import the package in your `wally.toml`:

    ```toml
    LuaEncode = "chadhyatt/luaencode@1.4.4"
    ```

* ### Roblox Marketplace

    You can also grab the LuaEncode module from the Roblox Marketplace: <https://roblox.com/library/12791121865>

___

## 🚀 Basic Usage

```lua
local LuaEncode = require("path/to/LuaEncode")

local Table = {
    foo = "bar",
    baz = {
        1,
        2,
        3,
        [5] = 5,
    },
    qux = function()
        return "\"hi!\"" -- With `FunctionsReturnRaw` set as true in options, this will output as 'qux = "hi!"'
    end,
}

local Encoded = LuaEncode(Table, {
    Prettify = true,
    FunctionsReturnRaw = true,
})

print(Encoded)
```

<details open>
<summary>Output</summary>
<br />
<ul>

```lua
{
    qux = "hi!",
    baz = {
        1,
        2,
        3,
        [5] = 5
    },
    foo = "bar"
}
```

</ul>
</details>

## 🔨 API

```lua
LuaEncode(inputTable: {[any]: any}, options: {[string]: any}): string
```

### Options

| Argument           | Type                | Description                         |
|:-------------------|:--------------------|:------------------------------------|
| Prettify           | `<boolean:false>`  | Whether or not the output should be [pretty printed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prettyprint#Programming_code_formatting) |
| IndentCount        | `<number:0>`       | The amount of characters that should be used for indents (**Note**: If `Prettify` is set to true and this is unspecified, it will default to `4`) |
| InsertCycles       | `<boolean:false>`  | If there are cyclic references in your table, the output will be wrapped in an anonymous function that manually sets paths to those references. (**NOTE:** If a key in the index path to the cycle is a reference type (e.g. `table`, `function`), the codegen can't externally set that path, and the value will have to be ignored) |
| OutputWarnings     | `<boolean:true>`   | If "warnings" should be placed into the output as comment blocks |
| FunctionsReturnRaw | `<boolean:false>`  | If `function` values should be treated as callbacks that return a string to be inserted directly into the serialized output as the key/value |
| UseInstancePaths   | `<boolean:true>`  | If Roblox `Instance` values should return their Lua-accessable path for serialization. If the instance is parented under `nil` or isn't under `game`/`workspace`, it'll always fall back to `Instance.new(ClassName)` |
| UseFindFirstChild  | `<boolean:true>`  | When `options.UseInstancePaths` is true, whether or not instance paths should use `FindFirstChild` instead of direct indexes |
| SerializeMathHuge  | `<boolean:true> ` | If "infinite" (or negative-infinite) numbers should be serialized as `math.huge`. (uses the `math` global, as opposed to just a direct data type) If false, "`1/0`" or "`-1/0`" will be serialized, which is supported on all target Lua environments |
