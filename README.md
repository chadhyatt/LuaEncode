## üéâ About

LuaEncode is a simple library for serialization of Lua tables and data structures, with support for Roblox's engine data types. LuaEncode natively supports both Luau and Lua 5.1+

### üåü Features

* Serialization and output of basic types `number`, `string`, `table`, `boolean`, and `nil` for key/values
* Pretty-printing and custom indentation configuration
* Compatible with custom Roblox data types (e.g. `Instance`, `UDim2`, `Vector3`, `DateTime`, etc..) - See **[Roblox Engine Data Type Coverage](#roblox-engine-data-type-coverage)** for more info
* Securely iterates and reads values, with potentially untrusted inputs in-mind
* Manual cycle inserts in serialized codegen with [`InsertCycles`](#api)
* Raw key/value input with [`FunctionsReturnRaw`](#api)

___

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

* ### Rojo/Wally

    If you're using [Rojo](https://rojo.space) and [Wally](https://wally.run/), you can import the package in your `wally.toml`:

    ```toml
    LuaEncode = "regginator/luaencode@1.4.3"
    ```

* ### Roblox Marketplace

    You can also grab the LuaEncode module from the Roblox Marketplace directly: <https://roblox.com/library/12791121865>

___

## üöÄ Basic Usage

```lua
local LuaEncode = require("path/to/LuaEncode")

local Table = {
    foo = "bar",
    baz = {
        1,
        2,
        3,
        [5] = 5,
    },
    qux = function()
        return "\"hi!\"" -- With `FunctionsReturnRaw` set as true in options, this will output as 'qux = "hi!"'
    end,
}

local Encoded = LuaEncode(Table, {
    Prettify = true, -- false by default (when this is true, IndentCount is also 4!)
    FunctionsReturnRaw = true, -- false by default
})

print(Encoded)
```

<summary>Output</summary>
<br />
<ul>

```lua
{
    qux = "hi!",
    baz = {
        1,
        2,
        3,
        [5] = 5
    },
    foo = "bar"
}
```

</ul>
</details>

## üî® API

```lua
LuaEncode(inputTable: {[any]: any}, options: {[string]: any}): string
```

### Options

| Argument           | Type                | Description                         |
|:-------------------|:--------------------|:------------------------------------|
| Prettify           | `<boolean:false>`  | Whether or not the output should use [pretty printing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prettyprint#Programming_code_formatting) |
| IndentCount        | `<number:0>`       | The amount of "spaces" that should be indented per entry (*Note: If `Prettify` is set to true and this is unspecified, it'll be set to `4` automatically*) |
| InsertCycles       | `<boolean:false>`  | If there are cyclic references in your table, the output will be wrapped in an anonymous function that manually sets paths to those references. **NOTE: If a key in the index path to the cycle is a reference type (e.g. `table`, `function`), the codegen can't externally set that path, and will be ignored.** |
| OutputWarnings     | `<boolean:true>`   | If "warnings" should be placed to the output (as comments); it's recommended to keep this enabled, however it can be disabled at ease |
| FunctionsReturnRaw | `<boolean:false>`  | If functions in said table return back a "raw" value to place in the output as the key/value |
| UseInstancePaths   | `<boolean:true>`  | If `Instance` reference objects should return their Lua-accessable path for encoding. If the instance is parented under `nil` or isn't under `game`/`workspace`, it'll always fall back to `Instance.new(ClassName)` as before |
| SerializeMathHuge  | `<boolean:true> ` | If numbers calculated as "infinite" (or negative-inf) numbers should be serialized with "math.huge". (uses the `math` import, as opposed to just a direct data type) If false, "`1/0`" or "`-1/0`" will be serialized, which is supported on all target versions |
